## Project Motivation
FIFA 19 is one of the most popular football games. In this project we analyzed Fifa 19 players dataset and try to predict a player potential. The analysis uses CRISP-DM method for our analysis process. The process is as follows:

1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment


The following are the questions we are interested in answering:

Q1: What's the ratio of total wages/ total potential for clubs.

Q2: Which are the high spending clubs? Which clubs are the most economical ？

Q3: What's the age distribution like? Is it related to player's overall rating? if yes, how is it related?

Q4: How is a player's skils set influence his potential? Can we predict a player's potential based on his skills' set?

## Installations
1. Python
2. Libraries: sklearn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
3. Jupyter notebook

## File Description
- data.csv: Contains the FIFA 19 dataset

## Results
1. Money plays a crucial role in a club’s performance. Big clubs have been and will continue to spend huge amount of money in order to compete to win trophies.

2. A lot of players ended the career after 26 years of age. But there are a few players who continue to play football even at the age of 40.

3. Ball control, reaction, and age are the main determinants of a player’s potential. People playing this game should focus on these factors to purchase players for their clubs.
